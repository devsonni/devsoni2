I am a senior undergraduate student in the Department of Mechatronics Engineering at [ITM Vocational University](https://www.itm.ac.in), where I am specializing in Mechatronics, Robotics & Controls. 

Since the last summer, I am working at [MOON-Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/m00nlab/home) of [Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Bhopal](https://www.iiserb.ac.in/) as a Research Intern under the guidance of [Dr. P. B. Sujit](https://eecs.iiserb.ac.in/faculty_profile.php?id=OQ==&lname=c3VqaXQ=) where I am working on cutting edge research topic of Learning Controllers made by combining Artificial Intelligence techniques with core Control System concepts and implementation of them on Robotic Systems for improving iterative performance.

During my graduation, I did many robotics projects and participated in a couple of robotics competitions, some of the selected projects presented under the project section.
