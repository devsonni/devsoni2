# 🎯 Motto 
- World is filled with a plethora of waste plastics, and only ~33% of plastic gets recycled: motto behind the development of these machines is to recycle plastic waste at the place where it forms means decentralization of the recycling process, with the use of these machines a community can recycle their plastic waste; can produce robust and purposeful products.
- This project was supported by SSIP (Student Start-up and Innovation Policy) of the Gujarat Government and received 83,899 ₹ grand.

# ⚙️ Compression Molding Machine

- The compression machine is basically an electric kitchen oven to heat the plastic, and a compression mechanism (a carjack) to apply pressure to your mold. The process is slower than the extrusion machines but it allows for larger molds to be used. It can be used to create raw material, like sheets or shapes that can be further worked on to make new products and gives a specific flake-like look to the plastic (which looks amazing!).
